# React Native Map Link

An easy way to open a location in a map app of the user's choice, based on the apps they have installed
on their device.

Currently supported apps:

* Apple Maps – `apple-maps`
* Google Maps – `google-maps`
* Citymapper – `citymapper`
* Uber – `uber`
* Lyft – `lyft`
* Navigon – `navigon`
* The Transit App – `transit`
* Waze – `waze`
* Yandex.Navi – `yandex`
* Moovit - `moovit`


## Installation

```
npm i -S react-native-map-link         # or yarn add react-native-map-link
```

### A note about iOS 9+
As of iOS 9, your app needs to provide the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key inside
Info.plist to specify the URL schemes with which the app can interact.

Just put this in your Info.plist depending on which apps you'd like to support.
Omitting these might mean that the library can't detect some of the maps apps installed by the user.

```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
        <string>comgooglemaps</string>
        <string>citymapper</string>
        <string>uber</string>
        <string>lyft</string>
        <string>navigon</string>
        <string>transit</string>
        <string>waze</string>
        <string>yandexnavi</string>
        <string>moovit</string>
    </array>
```

## Usage

```
import { showLocation } from 'react-native-map-link'

showLocation({
    latitude: 38.8976763,
    longitude: -77.0387185,
    sourceLatitude: -8.0870631,  // optional
    sourceLongitude: -34.8941619,  // not optional if sourceLatitude is specified
    title: 'The White House',  // optional
    googleForceLatLon: false,  // optionally force GoogleMaps to use the latlon for the query instead of the title
    googlePlaceId: 'ChIJGVtI4by3t4kRr51d_Qm_x58',  // optionally specify the google-place-id
    // app: 'uber'  // optionally specify specific app to use
})
```

* The `sourceLatitude/sourceLongitude` options only work if you specify both. Currently supporting all apps, except `Waze and Navigon`, if you want to specify the source lat/long instead of let the app choose your current location.
